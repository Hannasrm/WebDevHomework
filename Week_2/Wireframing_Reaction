	I found the article on wireframing to be very helpful giving me a general idea of what the 
	important aspects of wireframing are, as well as some of the potential problems to try to avoid
	in the development process. The five steps mentioned in the article begin with asking the 
	designer to clarify the problem they/their client wants solved. This first step seems important 
	in narrowing what the project is and why it is being done in the first place. The Workflows and 
	Sketches consideration discusses the importance of sketching out screens and workflows for both 
	the user and for developers. The last three steps, Getting Feedback, Knowing Your Tools, and 
	Knowing Your Audience all caution against jumping into a project without gaining as much 
	knowledge as possible through collaboration with others and possibly through previous research 
	done on the problem at hand. Overall, the article provides a framework to follow in order to 
	prevent mistakes/problems before they happen as much as is possible. This pre-planning seems 
	essential, especially in big or time-crunched projects, as a mistake early on could lead to 
	wasted time and efforts.
